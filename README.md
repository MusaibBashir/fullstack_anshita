## Description

This project is an AI-powered tool that allows users to describe the kind of document they want to write, generate a structured outline using an AI model (I have used gemini), and edit content under each heading in a rich text editor. The editor locks the generated headings so users can only write under them, not modify or delete the headings.

## Features

- **Chat-style UI:** Users enter a description of the document they want to create.
- **AI-generated outline:** The system uses an AI API to generate a markdown-style outline with headings and subheadings. I hve used gemini
- **Rich text editor with locked headings:** Users can write content under each heading, but cannot edit or delete the headings themselves. I have used tip tap editor.
